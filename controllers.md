**[Introduction Scene]**

_Scene_: You introduce the topic with a title card that reads: "Spring Boot E-commerce Application - Controller Layer Explained."

_Voiceover_: "Welcome back, everyone! In today's video, we'll be diving into the controller layer of our Spring Boot e-commerce application. We'll walk through each controller, explaining how they manage HTTP requests for various entities like `Cart`, `CartItems`, `Category`, `Customer`, `Orders`, `Payment`, and `Product`. Let's get started!"

**[CartController Explanation]**

_Scene_: Display the `CartController` code on the screen.

```java
package com.example.demo.Controllers;

import com.example.demo.Entities.Cart;
import com.example.demo.Services.CartService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/carts")
public class CartController {

    @Autowired
    private CartService cartService;

    @GetMapping
    public List<Cart> getAllCarts() {
        return cartService.getAllCarts();
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Cart> getCartById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        Cart cart = cartService.getCartById(id);
        if (cart != null) {
            return ResponseEntity.ok(cart);
        } else {
            return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
        }
    }

    @PostMapping
    public Cart createCart(@RequestBody Cart cart) {
        return cartService.saveCart(cart);
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Cart> updateCart(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Cart cart) {
        Cart existingCart = cartService.getCartById(id);
        if (existingCart != null) {
            cart.setCartId(id);
            return ResponseEntity.ok(cartService.saveCart(cart));
        } else {
            return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
        }
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Void> deleteCart(@PathVariable Long id) {
        Cart cart = cartService.getCartById(id);
        if (cart != null) {
            cartService.deleteCart(id);
            return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();
        } else {
            return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
        }
    }
}
```

_Voiceover_:
"Let's start with the `CartController`. This controller handles all the HTTP requests related to the `Cart` entity.

- The `@RestController` annotation indicates that this class is a controller where every method returns a domain object instead of a view.
- The `@RequestMapping("/api/carts")` annotation maps HTTP requests to `/api/carts` to methods within this controller.
- We have a `CartService` injected using `@Autowired` that manages the business logic.

The `getAllCarts` method is mapped to a `GET` request, returning a list of all carts by calling the `getAllCarts` method from the `CartService`.

The `getCartById` method fetches a specific cart based on the ID provided in the URL path. If the cart exists, it returns the cart; otherwise, it returns a 404 Not Found status.

The `createCart` method handles `POST` requests to create a new cart. The `@RequestBody` annotation binds the HTTP request body to the `Cart` object.

The `updateCart` method handles `PUT` requests, updating an existing cart. The `setCartId` method is used to set the ID to ensure the existing cart is updated.

Finally, the `deleteCart` method handles `DELETE` requests, deleting a specific cart by ID. If the cart exists, it's deleted, and a `204 No Content` status is returned."

**[CartItemsController Explanation]**

_Scene_: Display the `CartItemsController` code on the screen.

_Voiceover_:
"Next, let's move on to the `CartItemsController`. This controller manages the cart items, which link products to carts.

Here, we use a composite key, `CartItemsId`, that combines `cartId` and `pId` (product ID) to uniquely identify each cart item.

- The `getAllCartItems` method returns a list of all cart items.
- The `getCartItemsById` method retrieves a specific cart item based on the composite key.
- The `createCartItems` method allows the creation of a new cart item.
- The `updateCartItems` method updates an existing cart item based on the composite key.
- The `deleteCartItems` method removes a cart item based on its ID.

This controller follows the same pattern as `CartController`, ensuring that each method is properly mapped to HTTP requests."

---

**[CategoryController Explanation]**

_Scene_: Display the `CategoryController` code on the screen.

_Voiceover_:
"Moving forward, the `CategoryController` manages the categories of products.

- The `getAllCategories` method retrieves all categories from the database.
- The `getCategoryById` method fetches a specific category by its ID.
- The `createCategory` method allows the addition of a new category.
- The `updateCategory` method updates an existing category.
- The `deleteCategory` method removes a category by its ID.

As with the other controllers, the structure remains consistent, following RESTful principles."

---

**[CustomerController Explanation]**

_Scene_: Display the `CustomerController` code on the screen.

_Voiceover_:
"Our `CustomerController` is responsible for managing customer data. It includes all the basic CRUD operations:

- `getAllCustomers` fetches all customers.
- `getCustomerById` retrieves a specific customer.
- `createCustomer` adds a new customer.
- `updateCustomer` updates customer details.
- `deleteCustomer` removes a customer.

Each method in this controller ensures that customer data is handled securely and efficiently."

---

**[OrdersController Explanation]**

_Scene_: Display the `OrdersController` code on the screen.

_Voiceover_:
"Next up is the `OrdersController`, managing the orders placed by customers. This controller follows the same RESTful pattern:

- `getAllOrders` retrieves all orders.
- `getOrderById` fetches a specific order.
- `createOrder` allows for creating a new order.
- `updateOrder` handles the updating of an existing order.
- `deleteOrder` removes an order.

This ensures that order data is always up-to-date and managed according to the application's needs."

---

**[PaymentController Explanation]**

_Scene_: Display the `PaymentController` code on the screen.

_Voiceover_:
"Finally, let's look at the `PaymentController`, which manages payments in our e-commerce application. The controller includes:

- `getAllPayments` to fetch all payment records.
- `getPaymentById` to retrieve a specific payment.
- `createPayment` to handle new payments.
- `updatePayment` to update an existing payment record.
- `deletePayment` to remove a payment.

This controller ensures that all transactions are securely managed, reflecting the payment status in our system."

---

**[ProductController Explanation]**

_Scene_: Display the `ProductController` code on the screen.

_Voiceover_:
"Lastly, the `ProductController` is in charge of managing the products in our e-commerce platform. This includes:

- `getAllProducts` to retrieve all products.
- `getProductById` to fetch a specific product.
- `createProduct` to add a new product.
- `updateProduct` to update an existing product.
- `deleteProduct` to remove a product.

The `ProductController` is crucial for maintaining our product catalog, ensuring that all product data is accurately reflected in the application."
